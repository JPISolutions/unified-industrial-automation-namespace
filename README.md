# unified-industrial-automation-namespace
Welcome to UIAN - the Unified Industrial Automation Namespace Project. There are a lot of different protocols and ways to move buckets of data from point A to point B. What is not always easy is moving that data with the necessary context. When industrial programmers create context around their data it is not always the same as someone else's and it is not always the same project to project or client to client. We hope to simplify that. 

The UIAN project will give industrial programmers a place where they can collaborate on what basic object structures will look like and what the context tags should be named. The end result will be some simple object notation that can be used in PLC programming projects, in data mapping (using MQTT/Sparkplug B or HTTP REST/JSON), and in HMI projects (Ignition, ClearSCADA, etc.). 

## Recommendations

1. Level 5 and deeper tag names should be written in PascalCase.
