# Todo List

- [ ] Create documents for basic structures
- [ ] Create folders for programming examples, one folder per platform (Allen Bradley, Ignition, ClearSCADA, etc.)
- [ ] Provide some more substance to the vision and description of the project
- [ ] Provide some links to howto articles on how to contribute to Github projects
- [ ] Get some more contributors
- [ ] Cross reference the structures against some known standards (why re-invent the wheel?)
